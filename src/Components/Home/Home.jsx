                    <p className="changeTitle">Change Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow</p>
                    <p>Since time immemorial, human civilizations have thrived along the river banks. But focus on economic development has put pressure on our natural environment including, the water resources. Unfortunately, the water bodies today have been converted into dumping areas for human, animal and industrial wastes.</p>

                    <p className="changeTitle">Water Recycling</p>
                    <p>The need of the hour with the ever-increasing population and the given limited water resources, water recycling becomes all the more important and urgent in order to reduce the high-water stress in India. Thereby creating multiple water recycling opportunities that ease the acute pressure on our groundwater, which then can be used for drinking and other imperative usages.</p>

                    <p className="changeTitle">Japan's Water Story</p>
                    <p>Japan is a nation richly endowed with clean water. Despite using the water resources optimally, rapid industrial development over the decades pushed it further to its limits, thereby giving birth to the need to recycle. Through a holistic approach involving law, policies, technology, execution framework and clear priorities, Japan was able to come out of this adversity and make their water and environment beautiful again.</p>

                    <p>India is one of the most blessed countries in the world in terms of natural resources. However, the increasing demand for domestic, industrial and agriculture uses has put a strain on most of the river basins. While India is facing water scarcity, on one hand, it is battling with polluted water resources on the other across the country.</p>
